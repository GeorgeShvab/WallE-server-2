# WallE

WallE is a web app for making notes.
I was tired of countless Windows notebooks on the desktop that I used to hold some code examples, API keys, and Zoom links, so I created this app.
On GitHub, this repository has been named Walle 2 because I already created a less advanced app with the same name and purpose.

In this app, I used TypeScript, NestJs, React, MongoDB and a bunch of other technologies.

This was my first time working with NestJs, and I really like this framework.

This app has two repositories, one for the client and the second for the backend. Except for API, I also use the backend as a static server for client code, so I don't need to make another one server for a client.

I also wanted to make a landing page but changed my mind.
